# CWE
Rewriting the chapter "Communicating Without Errors" from the book "proofs from THE BOOK" in Latex.

# Project Overview
The project is divided into two parts, "firstpart.tex" and "secondpart.tex", each authored by different team members. The first five pages are covered in "firstpart.tex", while "secondpart.tex" contains subsequent five pages. The consolidated document, "CWE.tex", combines both parts and includes correct bibliography styling.
