# CWE
Rewriting the chapter "Communicating Without Errors" from the book "proofs from THE BOOK" in Latex.

# Project Overview

## %% PLEASE READ "Project Assessment.pdf" %%

The project is divided into two parts, "firstpart.tex" and "secondpart.tex", each authored by different team members. The first five pages are covered in "firstpart.tex", while "secondpart.tex" contains subsequent five pages. The consolidated document, "CWE.tex", combines both parts and includes correct bibliography styling (utilizing CWE.bbl).

# Compiling

Use ![this link](https://github.com/xemadp/CWE/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to download the project and use your standard latex compiler to compile into pdf.
The needed CWE.bbl is already present, there is no need to overwrite it with bibtex or biber,
however doing so will not produce any errors.
